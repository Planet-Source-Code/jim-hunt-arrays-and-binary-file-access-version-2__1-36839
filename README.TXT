About:

This example demonstrates how to use a dynamic array and user-defined types (UDT's) to load and save the contents of a binary file used as a simple flat-file database.

This type of data access will also reduce your project distribution size by several megabytes, since you won't need to include DAO/ADO/RDO support files with your app!

I often use this to save program settings instead of using INI files or the registry.

If you find this project useful in any way, post your comment good or bad!" & vbCrLf

You may use this however you see fit... Enjoy!
